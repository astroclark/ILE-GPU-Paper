\title{Accelerating parameter inference with graphics processing units}

\begin{abstract}
Gravitational wave Bayesian parameter inference involves repeated comparisons of GW data to generic candidate predictions.
Even with algorithmically efficient methods like RIFT or reduced-order quadrature, the time needed to perform these
calculations and overall computational cost can be significant compared to the minutes to hours needed to achieve the
goals of low-latency multimessenger astronomy.  By translating some elements of the RIFT algorithm to operate on
graphics processing units (GPU), we demonstrate substantial performance improvements, enabling dramatically reduced
overall cost and latency.

\section{Introduction}

\section{Methods}

* Review ILE

* Rewrite in matrix form

* GPU code

* Refactoring code to use the efficient GPU loops

** discuss tradeoffs: how to balance overall runtime.  When the cost of the waveform integration matters.

\section{Results}

* Comparison: agreement.  Sky localization example

* Benchmarking performance (new speed for BBHs; also show BNS with tides)



\section{Conclusions}

* Enable low-latency parameter inference in basically real time for GW candidate sources, even for relatively costly
models with full physics

* Highly portable, generalizable to other codes
